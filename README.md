## Intro to searching algorithms

### Sequential search O(n)
This is the most simple search algorithm. It takes in a vector and an integer that wants to be searched for. It loops over a vector, returning the position of the searched number in the vector. If not found, -1 is returned. 

In the main, we use the position to then print the looked for integer.
